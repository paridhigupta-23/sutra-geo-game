## Latest Grand-Finale Expansion

- Discover now covers **28 Indian states + 112 featured districts**. State cards use imagery; district chips open a working district-detail modal with heritage, food, culture, map, planner and Indian tourism source links.
- Heritage Map now includes the expanded district discovery layer, clickable images for every heritage node, food/event markers, India-wide default view, district focus links, and a working browser geolocation marker + accuracy circle.
- Removed the **42 MB** visual claim from the map.
- Food expanded to **26 entries** with images and direct official website links where available.
- Events expanded to **25 entries** with images and direct official event/tourism pages.
- Navigation now exposes **Food, Events and Living Heritage** directly.
- Planner now changes by selected state + district + mood and combines nearby district heritage, food and optional festival/event stops rather than returning one fixed route.
- Ask Sutra now resolves app states, districts, heritage nodes, food and events from the local SUTRA-GEO dataset instead of returning one generic answer.
- Quest now has a **Daily Sutra** reward and a **10-question Arena Competition** with score, local leaderboard and bonus Sutra Coins, plus 55+ cultural questions.
- Grounded source links in the prototype use Indian tourism/government or official venue/event websites; international heritage sources were removed from the UI/data source layer.
